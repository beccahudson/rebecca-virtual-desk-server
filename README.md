## Need

Virtual students have always dealt with issues getting help with assignments within 48 hours; leaving them stressed and consistently getting behind. Virtual Teachers carry a big role with many students and do the best that they can.

With the state of our nation, dealing with a pandemic forcing families to stay home, so many of them are enrolling their children into the virtual environment. 48 hours+ will become the norm and our children will never catch up.

## Description

Virtual Desk is an app for students to get help more efficiently from a pool of approved resources such as teachers and teacher assistants. Not only will students be able to get help faster, it will also free the teachers from being the only available source for students to seek help.

## How It Works

As the student, I can:

- View my "Help Queue" listing all New tickets, In Progress and Closed tickets.
- Open a help ticket by completing a form containing: subject, question and a due date for the assignment or project.
- Close a help ticket when I am satisfied with the help.

As the teacher, I can:

- View my "Help Queue" with a list of all current New tickets, In Progress and Closed tickets.
- Find a help ticket that I can pick up containing: subject, question and a due date of when the assignment or project.
- Close a help ticket when the student is satisfied with their help.
